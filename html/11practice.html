    <h1>Body</h1>
<h2>Body structure</h2>
<p>If we were to “break apart” the human body at the microscopic level, then the cell would constitute its most basic unit.
 The average adult has somewhere between 30–40 trillion cells, and an estimated 242 billion new cells are produced every day. When a select group of cells with similar functions come together, it forms a tissue.
    Tissues cumulate into organs, group of organs form organ systems and eventually, a complete organism.</p>
    <h3>Human body parts</h3>
    <p>The list of human body parts vary as the standard definition of an organ is still up for debate. However, there are an estimated 79 organs identified to date. We also possess organs that have “lost” their function throughout our evolution. Such organs are called vestigial organs.</p>
